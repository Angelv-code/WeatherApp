                <p class="ending">This Project was made to gain knowledge and experience 
                    with API's and JSON files. During the making of WeatherApp, I learned how to work in depth with JSON files.
                    Parameters were retrieved and used to display to the user the data that was collected. 
                    DOM elements were used to retrieve user input into event listeners to locate the correct object needed.
                    The URL that was provided on <a href = "https://openweathermap.org/current" class="openW">OpenWeatherMap</a> 
                    was fetched into the console to look through parameters with the correct value's intended for this project.
                    The URL was also fetched to collect and output a result with all the values from the parameters collected.
